Welcome

  Welcome to OAuth for Spring Security!

  As you can probably deduce from its name, the purpose of this project is to provide an {{{http://oauth.net}OAuth}}
  implementation for {{{http://static.springframework.org/spring-security/site/}Spring Security}}.  <As of version 3.0,
  support is provided for OAuth Spec 1.0a.> Support is also provided for both OAuth provider developers and OAuth consumer developers.
  As of version 3.13, there is also support for {{{./twolegged.html}two-legged OAuth}} (a.k.a. "Signed Fetch").

  As of version 3.17, some support for {{{http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-05}OAuth 2.0}} has been added. Future releases will
  add support for other OAuth 2.0 flows for both the client and the provider. Look at {{{http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/OAUTHSS-50}OAUTHSS-50}}
  to view the current progress of support for OAuth 2.0. Also note that OAuth 2.0 support is only available for Spring Security 3 and not
  implemented for Spring Security 2.x.

  Applying security to an application is not for the faint of heart, and OAuth is no exception. Before you get started,
  you're going to want to make sure you understand OAuth and the problem it's designed to address. There is good
  documentation at {{{http://oauth.net}the OAuth site}} and {{{http://oauth.net/documentation/getting-started}a good
  illustration of how OAuth is applied}}. You will also want to make sure you understand how {{{http://springframework.org/}Spring}}
  and {{{http://static.springframework.org/spring-security/site/}Spring Security}} work.

  With that, you're ready to get started.  You'll want to see {{{./tutorial.html}OAuth for Spring Security in action}}
  and read a more detailed explanation in the {{{./userguide.html}user guide}}.

  If you run into problems or have other questions, use the mailing list
  ({{{http://spring-security-oauth.codehaus.markmail.org/}archive}},
  {{{http://xircles.codehaus.org/manage_email/user\@spring-security-oauth.codehaus.org}subscribe}}).  Keep in mind that
  {{{http://webcohesion.com/}commercial support}} is also available.
